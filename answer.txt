1. Compare varargs and arrays
- Similarities:
+ Represent collections of elements of the same data type
- Differences:
	Array			Varargs
+ Fixed size		+ Not fixed size
+ Must create array	+ Directly pass parameters

In this case I prefer varargs to array because it is flexible. I have't to create a array of DVDs before calling addDigitalVideoDisc.

2.Q: Is Java a pass by value or a pass by reference programming language?
A: Java is considered a pass by value language. Java creates a copy of that reference and sends it to the method. This means any modifications within the method happen on the copied reference, not directly on the original object.

Q: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
A: Because Java create a copy for each DVD and method swap only swap two copies.

Q: After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?

A: Because the copy of jungleDVD points to disc jungleDVD. Changing title means change original object's title, so the title of jungleDVD is changed
